    "Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the development and implementation of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These systems are designed to mimic cognitive functions like problem-solving, learning, reasoning, and decision-making.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "An AI-powered virtual assistant, like Siri or Alexa, is a practical example of artificial intelligence. These assistants can understand natural language, respond to user queries, perform internet searches, set reminders, and even control smart home devices. They utilize machine learning and natural language processing techniques to continuously improve their performance and provide more accurate responses.\n",

    "Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computer systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms learn patterns and relationships within the data and use them to make informed predictions or take actions. The learning process involves training the algorithm on a large dataset and iteratively adjusting its parameters to optimize performance.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Example: Suppose you want to develop a spam email filter. You can use machine learning to train a model on a dataset containing examples of both spam and non-spam emails. The model learns the characteristics and patterns that distinguish spam emails from non-spam emails. Once trained, the model can analyze new incoming emails and classify them as spam or non-spam based on the patterns it has learned.\n",

    "Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on training artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These networks are designed to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data by extracting intricate features at different levels of abstraction. Deep learning has gained significant attention and success in recent years, especially in tasks involving large amounts of data like image and speech recognition.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Example: Image recognition is a common application of deep learning. For instance, a deep learning model called a convolutional neural network (CNN) can be trained on a large dataset of images to recognize objects within those images. By learning multiple layers of convolutional filters, the model can automatically extract meaningful features like edges, textures, and shapes. This allows the model to accurately classify and identify objects in new images, even if they differ in lighting conditions, angles, or other variations."

    "Training Set:\n",
    "The training set is the portion of the dataset used to train the machine learning model. It contains labeled examples, where both the input features and their corresponding target labels are provided. During the training process, the model learns from this labeled data by adjusting its internal parameters or weights to minimize the prediction errors. The training set is crucial as it forms the foundation for the model to learn patterns and relationships in the data.\n",

By evaluating the model's predictions on the test set, we can measure its accuracy, precision, recall, or other performance metrics. The test set helps us estimate how the model is likely to perform in real-world scenarios.\n",

The validation set helps in tuning hyperparameters, selecting the best model architecture, or making decisions on regularization techniques.
